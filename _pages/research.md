# Research projects

In my book project, I study economic elites' ideas about poverty and inequality and their preferences for taxation. The study is based on a mixed-methods approach, including more than 100 interviews, computerized text analysis, and a survey experiment. In an additional project related to economic elites, I study elite's use of offshore accounts, particularly how this changes over space and time. 

I am also interested in the political economy of social policy. [One of these projects](https://condicionalidades.wordpress.com/) is centered on Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) in Latin America - one of the most popular social policies in the region. This project explores differences in the CCT models adopted in the region and asks why some governments opt for a more punitive design than others. Relatedly, I am now investigating Guaranteed Income projects in the United States. Besides participating from the impact evaluation of Evanston's Guaranteed Income Pilot, I am researching the variation in the design of pilot programs around the country.   

Finally, I am collaborating on a project on the politics of opting out from public services. This originated as part of the [Latin American and Caribbean Inequality Review](https://lacir.lse.ac.uk/) initiative led by the London School of Economics.
