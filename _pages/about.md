I am a PhD Candidate (ABD) in Political Science at Northwestern University, where I am also completing a Masters in Applied Statistics. My research focuses on the politics of income inequality with a regional focus in Latin America. My work has been published in the *Journal of Politics in Latin America* and *Social Policy and Administration*. 

Before graduate school, I worked at the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in Montevideo, where I worked on projects regarding multidimensional child poverty, social expenditure, gender inequality in the labor market, and care policies. This research has been published in *Latin American Research Review* and *International Security Review*, as well as in multiple policy papers.
