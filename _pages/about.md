Hi! I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Northwestern University, where I am also completing an M.S. in Applied Statistics. My research focuses on the politics of income inequality with a regional focus in Latin America. Before coming to grad school, I received a B.A. in Political Science at the Universidad Cat√≥lica del Uruguay. I also worked at the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and did consulting work for other international organizations.
